== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the user profile for users to use to key in their basic information and workout preference*
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allows the WorkoutBook user to view and modify their user profile details and workout preference anytime.
** [.underline]#Justification#: This feature was implemented to allow WorkoutBook users to keep a user profile and their workout preference so that when they choose their workouts, it will show a warning if the workout they want to do does not meet their workout preference.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature affects the current and recommend command that are already available. The workout preference will be used in these 2 commands to provide a warning pop up message for the current command and the recommend command can be base on the user's preference.

* *Minor enhancement*:
