== Overview

TO BE CHANGED

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the memory feature which enables users to manage future, current and completed workouts*
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allows the WorkoutBook user add new workouts with an automatic state tag of `future`. In order to set 
a workout to current, he uses the `current` command which changes the state tag to `current`. He can then finish the workout by setting
the state tag to `completed` using the `complete` command. However, he can always choose to reactivate the workout by changing its state
tag to `current` using the `current` command again.
** [.underline]#Justification#: This feature was implemented to allow WorkoutBook users to remember easily the relevance of each workout
according to their desired criteria. `future` reminds the user that they are untouched. `current` informs the user that he is focussing 
on this specific one. `completed` tells the user that he has finished this workout before. This hence allows the user to avoid 
forgetting whether he has already performed the workout, etc.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature requires two new commands - current and complete as well as modification to the pre-existing 
add and edit commands to avoid affecting the state tag.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Created the seven classes of Type, Difficulty, Duration, Equipment, Instruction, Muscle and Calories for the Workout.
