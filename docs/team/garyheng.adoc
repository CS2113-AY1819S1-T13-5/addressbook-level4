== PROJECT: WorkoutBook

---

== Overview

TO BE CHANGED

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to track completed workouts with desired parameters*
** [.underline]#What it does#: This allowing the WorkoutBook user to have a history of completed workouts, based on their own preference of data to be kept. The user can hence keep track of completed workouts that match a user-defined criteria.
** [.underline]#Justification#: This feature was implemented to allow WorkoutBook users to keep a separate history of completed workouts, based on their desired criteria, thus allowing them to modify workouts in the WorkoutBook while still being able to access previously completed workouts that they have tracked.
** [.underline]#Highlights#: This feature requires heavy modification to the pre-existing Model and Storage components to facilitate the separate storage of both the tracked workouts and the user-defined criteria, to allow the user to maintain the tracking feature across separate instances of WorkoutBook usages.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Modified the `undo` and `redo` commands to implement Model-level versioning in order to allow for undoing and redoing of any form of storage modification across the various storage .xml files.
** Modified the overall WorkoutBook UI to fit the application's new functionality.
